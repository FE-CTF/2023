So you've got the whole thing figured out, you got your tools.  Let's go on a
journey.

May we suggest:

```
$ ./lolcat.py < lolcat.py
$ (tail -n+3 lolcat.py ; echo ; cat lolcat.py) | nc crackstation-level-1.hack.fe-ctf.dk 1337
```

`server.py` is running at `crackstation-level-1.hack.fe-ctf.dk:1337`.
