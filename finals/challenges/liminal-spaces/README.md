We've intercepted this... thing. I have no idea.

I sent it to the people in the lab, and they said the file was empty, with a
blank stare. Then they asked me to pay!

"Just put it on my tab", I told them. So I'm giving them a wide berth. They need
their space.

We need a new line of inquiry. Maybe you can help?
