Ahoy!

We have intercepted a secret communication, in an obscure format.

It seems to be a disk image for a rare and unusual UNIX system.

Our sources have managed to find a reference manual, but it's dated `2020-v1`,
so we don't know if it's 100% up to date. It's probably better than nothing,
though.

Our sources tell us, that this image might even contain a few traces of the
elusive Fenix kernel source code!

Can you figure out the format, and recover the flag?
